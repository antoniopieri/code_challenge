# Code Challenge

Plan
1.Explore and Prep
* Join the tables

* Create new 'Late' column

* Create age column from date of birth

2. Analyse

See how particular variables effect whether a book is returned late

Plots:

* Dsitribution of ages
* Distribution of ages (for both Male & female)

* Prob of being Late vs Age
* Prob of being Late vs length of book

With bins..

* Prob of Returning Late vs Age
* Prob of Returning Late vs Age (for M and F)
* Prob of Returning Late vs Age (for Rental Period 7 and 30)

* Prob of Returning Late vs Book length
* Prob of Returning Late vs Book Length (for rental period 7 and 30)
    
    

3. Plug some variables into a model (Try Decisiton Tree)
* Chose the following variables to put into model:

data_predictors=['length','rental_period', 'subject', 'title','ethnic_group', 'gender', 'age']

(Unforuntaely couldnt get model to fit)
